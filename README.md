# Power-Lifting-Analysis

## Overview
In this project, powerlifting data was analyzed to determine how the Powerlifting Open Division has changed over time. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle on this [webpage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/open-powerlifting/powerlifting-database). The dataset includes several divisions, but Open Division was chosen exclusively because it is open to all age and weight classes, which makes the data more generalizable to all powerlifters.

## Results

As seen in the line chart below, women have been gradually making up more and more of the participation pool in the open division. In 1980, women made up 10% of participants. From 1980 to 1985, participation jumped to 25%. This make-up was maintained from 1985 until around 2010, when it quickly jumped to roughly 33%, or a third of all participants. Although women are still largely the minority in a male-dominated sport, their involvement has shown sharp, sudden change over the last several deacdes. 

The equipment used has also changed overtime. In the 1960s, wraps were used exclusively. But as the sport evolved, wraps were abandaned for newly discovered equipment, such as straps. 

## Conclusion

Powerlifting has changed in various ways since the 1960s. Women are participating more frequently and the age and weight of participants has sharply increased. Unfortunately, this data only illustrates these changes, rather than telling us why these changes have occured. Future work should analyze the data of other divisions, including comparisons among multiple divisions. These analyses could bring insight as to which divisions are most successful or unique.
